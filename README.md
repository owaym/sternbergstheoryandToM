## 📘 Abstract

This project investigates the potential of combining Sternberg’s Theory of Thinking Styles with Theory of Mind (ToM) to enhance collective intelligence (CI) in group settings. While prior research shows that ToM is a strong predictor of CI, this paper explores how an understanding of thinking styles may strengthen ToM and, in turn, improve group performance, especially in both face-to-face and online collaborative environments.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore how Sternberg’s thinking styles relate to social-cognitive capabilities.
- Analyze how integrating thinking style awareness can enhance Theory of Mind.
- Examine implications for improving team collaboration and collective intelligence.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Theory of Mind (ToM):** The ability to understand and infer others' mental states.
- **Thinking Styles (Sternberg):** Preferred ways individuals process information and interact with their environment.
- **Collective Intelligence (CI):** Group’s ability to solve a wide variety of tasks together, going beyond individual capabilities.

## 📚 Contents

- Literature review on ToM and CI
- Comparison of assessment tools (e.g., RMET vs. TSIS)
- Theoretical basis and empirical support for thinking styles
- Practical implications in education, team training, and virtual collaboration

## 🔍 Highlights

- RMET's continued use as a reliable ToM test across cultures and environments
- Thinking styles as flexible, trainable, and socially grounded—making them ideal for CI enhancement
- Need for integrated frameworks in team-building and education that combine metacognitive and social-cognitive training

## 📈 Future Work

The paper suggests exploring:
- The direct interaction between ToM and thinking styles in real-world group dynamics
- Cross-cultural validation and refinement of thinking styles theory
- Technology-aided awareness tools for virtual collaboration
